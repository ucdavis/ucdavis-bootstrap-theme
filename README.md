# ucdavis-bootstrap-theme
Default Styles and Snippets for UC Davis Web Applications

# Install

Copy ucdavis.css or ucdavis.min.css into your preferred assets directory, and include it *after* bootstrap.

You may also want to move the fonts and media folder into your site, although the css references the fonts at "/fonts/...", so the css or path may have to be modified to get the fonts to show up correctly.

# Building

`gulp build` to produce sass and minified sass
